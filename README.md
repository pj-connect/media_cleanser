# Media Cleanser

## Monteal Gazette cleanser

A very simple python script to strip clutters from montreal gazette readability web page for people with an handicap situation.

This script is to be used on a downloaded [mozilla's firefox readable html page](https://github.com/mozilla/readability). The changes are made infile.

A text-to-speech can be used without earing debiltating cluters.

This script depends on [beautifulsoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup) python package.

This is, and will be, a work in progress.

**What's next (future features):**

- an URL could be provided, and the script would generate an uncluttered readable html page and launch it in your default browser ;
- an output file location could be specified ;
- Install pipx and install this script from the root directory like so ``` pipx install . ```.
